## Overview of the Project
The purpuse of this project is to give people the ability search through UFO Sightings
data for their own analysis.
We also provide the ability to filter the data with multiple criteria such as date, city,
state, country and shape of the UFO sighting for a more in-depth analysis.

## Results
To use the website, a user would enter in data for one or more of the filter fields and the
data table will update accordingly.
For example, here we have initial data table displays all of our data on UFO sightings.

We enter in a sighting date and hit the [enter] key. Which filters the data on all sightings reported
on the entered date.

We can also, filter by multiple criteria. For example, how many sightings were in California on the 
entered date. Enter in "ca" for California the state field and hit the [enter] key. The table will 
update with sightings in California on the entered date.

We can further filter by city.

## Summary
In summary, I feel there is one drawback of this design. That is entering in single data points per field.
Currenty, the user enters in a specific date for UFO date. If the date happens to have no
sightings then the table comes back blank. This could go on for multiple dates (more often than not).

One of my recommendations is to have the ability to enter in a date range for users to search.
My second recommendation would be to have multiple inputs per field. For example, enter in us,ca in the Country field for sightings in US and Canada only. Or enter in sphere, triangle for shpere and triangle shaped object sightings.
